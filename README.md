# Best-Deals

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a robust and scalable Multi-Vendor eCommerce Platform that enables multiple vendors to sell their products, while buyers can browse, search, and purchase products from different vendors on a single platform. This platform aims to create an online marketplace where multiple vendors can manage their products independently, while the platform owner can oversee the entire system.

By utilizing the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, the platform will offer modern, efficient, and secure solutions for both vendors and customers. It will also integrate modern technologies such as Redux for state management.
